# BOKOBLOCK

**Bokoblock** (stylized **BOKOBLOCK**) is an upcoming grid-based puzzle game I'm making. Made in [Godot 4.3](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/).

## Project

Everything is included in the [src](src/) directory.

## Notes

P.S. This repo exists as a way for me to learn git and github, and gain some experience.

### Heads up

The game, same with this repo, are obviously still in development. I'm working on the game, tracking changes, and learning more about git. You can view the codebase so far at your pace!
