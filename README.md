# BOKOBLOCK

**Bokoblock** (stylized **BOKOBLOCK**) is an upcoming grid-based puzzle game I'm making. Made in [Godot 4.3](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/).

## Project

Everything is included in the [bokoblock](bokoblock/) directory.

I wish I could say it's ideal to clone and import on Godot, but `bokoblock/audio/` is ignored from tracking/hidden due to legal reasons. Audio files are crucial and without them, it might cause issues with importing.

They'll be tracked when the game's audio is semi-finalized.

## Notes

P.S. This repo exists as a way for me to learn git and github, and gain some experience.

### Heads up

The game, same with this repo, are obviously still in development. I'm working on the game, tracking changes, and learning more about git. You can view the codebase so far at your pace!
